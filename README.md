# üß¨ Blood Report AI Agent

The **Blood Report AI Agent** is a scalable and fast AI-powered assistant that analyzes uploaded blood report PDFs and presents the findings in a user-friendly blog format. It uses an LLM backend, Redis for job queuing, and PostgreSQL for structured storage.

## üöÄ Features

- Upload PDF blood reports
- Queued background analysis using Redis
- Structured data stored in PostgreSQL
- LLM-based insights using Gemini
- Blog-style output for users
- Scalable microservice design

## üß™ Test

You can test the Blood Report AI Agent by making a **POST request** to the following endpoint:

```

https://reportai-o8em.onrender.com/analyze

````

### üîß Required Form Data

| Field Name | Type   | Description                            |
|------------|--------|----------------------------------------|
| `file`     | File   | The blood report PDF to be analyzed    |
| `query`    | String | Any natural language question or prompt related to the report |

### üì¨ Example Using `curl`

```bash
curl -X POST https://reportai-o8em.onrender.com/analyze \
  -F "file=@your_blood_report.pdf" \
  -F "query=Summarize the key abnormalities"
````

### üß™ Postman Collection
A Postman collection file is included in this repository (BloodReportAI_Test.postman_collection.json) for your convenience.
You can import it into Postman and run pre-configured tests instantly.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

There are **two apps** in this system:

### 1. üñ•Ô∏è Backend API

Run using:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or use hot-reloading (recommended during development):

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. üß† Background Processor

This listens to Redis for queued jobs and populates PostgreSQL with analyzed data.

Run it separately:

```bash
python processor.py
```
